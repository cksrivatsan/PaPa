Social robot: PaPa is a non-humanoid companion robot that helps in reducing anger. In the prototype stage, it has the following gestures- 1)Greet- nods when someone pats. 2)Anxious- gets nervous when someone fights near it. 3)Relaxed- calms down when someone pats it. Technically, the high intensity arguments/ conversations are sensed using a microphone sensor. The proximity sensor on top senses the human touch to interact with. All gestural movements are done using two servo motors mounted onto a 3D printed fixture. Interaction design and implementation done using an Arduino microcontroller.

Assistive device for the visually impaired: A simple device that can detect light only when the fingers snap in a particular pattern, to help visually impaired people to check the lights before leaving the room.
